Attack White House! Civil Rights Parsons! For the Greater Good of Humanity!</span><br><br>Now with upgraded formatting!<br><br><p style="text-decoration: underline;">Chapter 1: Ground Control to Major Parsons!</p><p>"Welcome to the 
Game of Life. Thanks for playing." That is what he said when we first 
stepped foot into his humble new classroom. It was a year to remember&#8230;</p><p>Mr.
 Parsons is a quirky fellow. Takes his programming seriously&#8230; ya know? 
He is a fallen angel sent to exhale from Businessworld Heaven. He has 
long, flowing hair&#8230; he is sorta a mix between Fabio and He Man. And the 
best part about him&#8230; is his rants. Oh&#8230; his rants. In Mr. P's last rant, 
he played his favorite song called <em>Milkin' and Ilkin'</em> while 
chugging a fat mug of Grapefruit Parsons Juice, concentrate made from 
his brother&#8212;Grapefruit Man Rocky Mountain King, who was, in fact, a 
banana. A ripe banana. If you are worried that Mr. Parsons commits 
fratricide every time he listens to <em>Milkin' and Ilkin'</em>, you are
 sadly mistaken; Grapefruit Man Rocky Mountain King actually uses some 
body fluid or something of his and concentrates it in a lab&#8230; I guess&#8230;</p><p>Today, in the middle of a rant that Mr. Parsons entitled <em>FBI Parsons</em>, a call was received on his phone&#8230;</p><p>"Mrgreatesrfoefmeameifherschsjfdnwus!" the phone proclaimed in a stout way.</p><p>"
 The plan is a go-go. Time to get my pogo! " Mr. Parsons sang, and a 
magical flying and flaming pogo stick came shooting from the stars, 
fueled by candy bars.</p><p>"OK, class. I need the blackest student I can in the class, so I can use them to replace Barack Obama."</p><p>There
 was a "shyster" in the class. His name in LaDonavan LaKeesha, we call 
him LaDonny for short. He honestly didn't like to have any attention, 
and he once fell into a fetal position when Mr. Parsons started licking 
him slowly behind the ear. Almost instinctively, LaDonny fell into a 
fetal position again at the very mention of his name by our great 
Parsons.</p><p>Mr. Parsons then sent his henchmen, little creatures that
 he calls hucklepucks to carry LaDonny to the back of the pogo stick. 
Poor, poor LaDonny. I honestly feel bad for him&#8230; always being pushed 
around by prominent weirdos&#8230; He has nowhere to go. Nowhere to turn to. 
Locked in an endless battle with himself for the simple fact that he 
doesn't have the will to voice his concerns&#8230;</p><p>Meanwhile, the cherry tree outside was growing Flabbios. Great stuff.</p><p>Uh, where was I? Oh&#8230; uh. Yeah, I felt bad for LaDonny, so I just had to help him.</p><p>Who is I? Oh, yesssshhh!</p><p>DUH DUH DUH DUHD UHD DUHD DUD!</p><p>PRESENTING!

HATING SEXY OLD MAN-LIKE IDIOT GENIOUS GOOD-FOR-NOTHING SLACKER!</p><p>My name?</p><p>Moist Onion Trick. Yes. Don't question it. My parents came up with that name after fighting three giant robots at the same time.</p><p>By
 sheer coincidence, pulling a "Moist Onion Trick" is actually a very 
popular term used throughout our world. It is amazing how fickle people 
are. First, it was Swag, then YOLO, then MLG, and finally, Moist Onion 
Trick. It was coined by a pop star by the penname "Freak! Prince 
Dashing" after he fought three champions in League of Legends at the 
same time. What a cool dude.</p><p>Mr. Parsons screamed a vivid, 
"AIYIYEYAH!" and crashed through the ceiling with his pogo stick, taking
 LeDonny with him. This was the instance where I sprang into action. 
"Janet, you call the front office to get a substitute teacher. Marty, 
you go and call a ceiling repair guy. I'll go save LeDonny!"</p><p>I 
shuffled through my FedoraMeister V2 Backpack (I got it for the sweet 
handlebars and quad-tinkler engine&#8230; not because I like fedoras) and I 
pulled out my Mirror Thingy. I got this from a bar after a necromancer 
killed everyone in my neighborhood. The Mirror Thingy is probably the 
most magical Thingy I have. It can do so much&#8230; if I can actually figure 
out how to use it. I have compiled a small research list of all the 
abilities it currently has:</p><p> I can see visions of whatever I want, at any time period in it.</p><p> I can blow bubbles with the mirror to create a cool mode of transportation.</p><p> I guess I can also time travel with the bubble? Only to the past, though&#8230;</p><p> I can see the immediate future with the mirror. Not too far though.</p><p> I can reflect light at a necromancer and kill it.</p><p>So,
 of course, an option that would work here is blowing a bubble with the 
mirror and flying in the sky, chasing after Mr. Parsons. Cool pants.</p><p>I
 blew into the circular mirror and a silvery and majestic bubble 
vibrantly appeared in front of the class's eyes. Seemed pretty normal to
 me, but the class never saw such beauty before.</p><p>Well, that's what
 I would say, but everyone was too busy looking at the hole in the 
ceiling that revealed the lone cherry tree outside that was growing 
Flabbios. Great stuff.</p><p></p><p style="text-decoration: underline;">Chapter 2: Kawaii in the Sky! Mr. Parsons Can Fly!</p><p>Mr. Parsons was nearing his mega airship, the <em>Kawaii Parsons, </em>on
 his flaming pogo stick with poor LaDonny attached to the end of it. Mr.
 Parson's long flowing hair was gently wafting in the breeze. The <em>Kawaii Parsons</em>
 was designed by master mechanic Karnicolo. He was probably the coolest 
guy around. Though, people tended to make fun of him because he was so 
short and had a really high pitched voice. The airship has a Parson's 
Lounge were Mr. Parsons can soak in his hot tub while his sharp and 
defined abs pilot the steering wheel.</p><p>So, there LaDonny was 
staring at the Hot Tub Parsons. "All right, LaDonny," Hot Tub Parsons 
said, "Time to get your tats." Mr. Parsons splashed the boiling hot tub 
water on LaDonny's forehead, creating three Dolla tattoos, and a stray 
drop of water created a tear tattoo underneath his eye. Mr. Parsons 
dipped his face in the water for 9 minutes. When he emerged, Mr. Parsons
 had a heart tattoo on his cheek, long spiky hair, huge eyes, and a 
fabulous goatee. The best part about his transformation is that he still
 looked like a mix between Fabio and He Man.</p><p>"OK, here's the plan 
LaDonny. We are going to invade the White House and take out the 
President so that I can ascend to a higher dimension of being."</p><p>"&#8230;" LaDonny replied.</p><p>"Now here is the plan," Hot Tub Parsons said as he slowly, slowly leaned in to LaDonny's ear.</p><p>Hot
 Tub Parsons whispered the plan to LaDonny while Donny was petrified 
from the thought that Hot Tub Parsons might lick his ear again.</p><p></p><p style="text-decoration: underline;">Chapter 3: The Plan of Parsons</p><p><em>Here he comes! He is coming our way!</em></p><p><em>He's our hero! And he's coming to say!</em></p><p><em>He will save us from death and destruction!</em></p><p><em>He can write almost any function!</em></p><p><em>He is!</em></p><p><em>HE IS!</em></p><p><em>LORD PARSONS!</em></p><p>"<em>Hammit!</em> What is this music!? Our dear Mr. President is trying to get some beauty sleep" one of the White House Secret Agents said.</p><p>"Yeah, he needs exactly 30 hours of sleep per day or else he can't do his duty," another Agent said.</p><p>"Um, Commander, I think that that airship is gettin' a little bit too close to the White House!"</p><p>"All right," the Commander replied, "Fire when I give the signal."</p><p>A circle of Secret Service huddled around the front lawn of the white house. They pointed their bazookas skyward towards the <em>Kawaii Parsons</em>.</p><p>Just
 then, LaDonny dropped from the sky and attempted to do his famous 360 
No-Scope with a Teezler. This would have worked, but the Commander had a
 lag switch. So, his 360 No-Scope turned into a 346 No-Scope, and 
LaDonny missed an Agent.</p><p>I was watching this through my Mirror 
Thingy&#8230; I could just see the White House in the distance with my own 
eyes&#8230; But it was too late. LaDonny was bazooka'ed. He gave a pitiful 
look on his face as his tear tattoo gleamed in the noonday sun. He gave a
 faint smile, crossed his arms above his head, and did a double peace 
sign as his head fell gently onto the bright green fescue.</p><p>This was the physical embodiment of a Moist Onion Trick.</p><p>My
 bubble burst a few feet above the White House Lawn, stained in 
hydraulic fluids. Yep, just as I thought. All of the secret service 
agents were cyborgs. Typical overspending of our President.</p><p>No&#8212;I mustn't get distracted. I must tend to LaDonny.</p><p>I ran as fast as I could walk until I was beside the fading LaDonny.</p><p>"Speak, LaDonny! SPEAK!"</p><p>"&#8230;"</p><p>"LADONNY! PLEASE!"</p><p>"I&#8230;"</p><p>"OUT WITH IT, MAN!"</p><p>"I'm free."</p><p>"NO! STAY WITH ME!"</p><p>"No,
 my time has come. You see this tear tattoo? It is not because I killed 
any other person. I&#8230; have killed myself. I should have been stronger. I 
should have been able to speak my mind out instead of doing whatever 
people tell me to do."</p><p>It was in this instance that my Mirror 
Thingy started pulsating. A laser light shot LaDonny's tear tattoo, and 
it peeled off into nothingness.</p><p>"LaDonny? Did&#8230; I just heal you?"</p><p>"No&#8230;
 I don't feel physically better&#8230; but I feel mentally better. I feel at 
peace with myself. I finally learned to speak my mind, and that's all 
that counts."</p><p>"No, man! You need to stay with me! You can live in a better way now! Please&#8230; just give me time to figure out this <em>hamn</em> mirror!"</p><p>"You know&#8230; I always&#8230;wanted&#8230;to be called&#8230; LaLa&#8230;"</p><p>And there he lied. Cold and lifeless on the ground. I had to avenge him.</p><p>Within
 a few feet of him was his famous Teezler, a gun that can shoot short 
ranged electric shocks or long ranged heavy metal dubstep rap music. I 
swiftly grabbed it and entered the white house, following the carnage of
 cyborgs that Mr. Parsons left behind.</p><p></p><p style="text-decoration: underline;">Chapter 4: Parson's Ascension</p><p>"Huh? How did you manage to get past security?" the fat hairy oath of a security guard, Stinky Dinky, spat out.</p><p>"I
 licked them behind the ear, of course. Everybody knows that this is how
 you short circuit cyborgs. And people by the name of LaDonavan 
LaKeesha," Mr. Parsons replied humbly.</p><p>"Well, I'm the last Agent 
before Mr. President himself. And I am the best. Ain't even a cyborg! 
Time for you to die!" Stinky Dinky scoffed.</p><p>"Hmm. It is not Time for me to die&#8230; but it is another time&#8230;"</p><p>Mr. Parsons snapped his fingers and pointed to Hinky Dinky.</p><p>"&#8230;It's Reyn Time."</p><p>Just then, a flash of radiant light engulfed the whole room.</p><p>"Ugh&#8230;
 Time to get up already?" Barack Obama sheepishly muttered as the 
intense light seeped past the cracks of his ponderous door.</p><p><strong><em>BANG!</em></strong> The door flung off its hinges and crashed just before the foot of Obama's bed.</p><p>There
 was Super Saiyan Parsons, the penultimate form of all the Parsons. His 
spiky hair was leaking out powerful energy, and his shirt was torn off, 
revealing his throbbing abdominals.</p><p>"&#8230;Sugoi&#8230;" Parsons uttered.</p><p>"Now
 let me be clear," Obama declared, "I don't mean any harm. I know I 
purposely put cookies inside the bacon jar, but do you have to wake me 
up for this?"</p><p>"Gomen'nasai, Obama-sama&#8230;" Super Saiyan Parsons asserted.</p><p>"I NEED THE DUBBED VERSION, FOR CHEESE'S SAKE!" Obama-sama squealed.</p><p>"BAKA!
 Ehem. Sorry, Mr. Obama," Super Saiyan Parsons clarified as he popped a 
red lollipop into his defined mouth and lit it on fire, "I need to 
ascend to a higher dimension of being&#8230; and you know what that means&#8230;"</p><p>"No&#8230; You are a Parsons! Anything but a Parsons! NO! Please, don't do this to me! THIS IS NOT FAIR!"</p><p>Super Saiyan Parsons looked up and glared towards Barack Obama.</p><p><strong>"</strong><strong>Welcome to the Game of Life. Thanks for playing."</strong></p></body></html>
